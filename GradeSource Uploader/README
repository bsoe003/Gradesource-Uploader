EXAMPLE:
python -c 'import gradesourceuploader; gradesourceuploader.updateScores("cshao", "99999", "111111", "grades.csv")'

the CSV file should contain

MAKE SURE THE CSV CONTAINS EVERY EMAIL FROM GRADESOURCE FOR THAT ACCOUNT.
AN EASY WAY IS TO GENERATE AN EXCEL DOCUMENT AND THEN REMOVE THE FIRST COLUMN AFTER DONE INPUTTING GRADES


See sample.csv for example
