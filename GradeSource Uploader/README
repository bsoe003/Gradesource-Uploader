Usage:
This python script is used to mass import grades into Gradesource.
It has two functions: 
- Download student name and email into a CSV file (CSV format: Name, Email)
- Send a CSV file to Gradesource to update a certain score (CSV format: Email, score)


To find the course ID:
Login to Gradesource.
Click on edit course.
In the URL it should be https://www.gradesource.com/editcourse.asp?id=XXXXX
the number after id= is your course ID

To find the assignment ID:
Login to Gradesource.
Click on Scores.
Find the Assignment that you would like to modify.
In the URL it should be https://www.gradesource.com/editscores1.asp?id=XXXXXX
the number after id= is your assignment ID

To use: 
To download student name and email (don't forget to use quotes):

python -c 'import gradesourceuploader; gradesourceuploader.downloadEmail(login, courseID)'
EXAMPLE: 
python -c 'import gradesourceuploader; gradesourceuploader.downloadEmail("cshao", "99999")'

To upload scores from a CSV file:
python -c 'import gradesourceuploader; gradesourceuploader.updateScores(login, courseID, assignmentID, CSVFile)'
EXAMPLE:
python -c 'import gradesourceuploader; gradesourceuploader.updateScores("cshao", "99999", "111111", "grades.csv")'

the CSV file should contain
email@email.com,score
score can be empty as well

####NOTE####
MAKE SURE THE CSV CONTAINS EVERY EMAIL FROM GRADESOURCE FOR THAT ACCOUNT.
AN EASY WAY IS TO GENERATE THE CSV  DOCUMENT AND THEN REMOVE THE FIRST COLUMN AFTER DONE INPUTTING GRADES


See sample.csv for example of updateScores
